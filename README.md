### Hello! 🐹
I'm fzzyhmstrs! I code Minecraft mods for fun, and cost modeling tools for work. I also do pixel art, which you can see showcased in all my mods! My published mods can be found at my [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/fzzyhmstrs/projects) and my [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/fzzyhmstrs)
